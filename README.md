An extension of maps introduced in LekMod, and much of the main generation is taken from those files. The rest of SadMod can be found here: https://github.com/RyanBilash/Sadmod/tree/main

If you are going to use this, you also need LekMap (currently v5.2) and LekMod (currently v33.11, but this version isn't all that important for this I think).

You can just drag these files directly into your civ5/Assets/Maps/ directory or you can make a subdirectory civ5/Assets/Maps/Sadmap

Changed files:

SadderFeatureGen - HBFeatureGenerator

SadderMapGen - HBMapGenerator

Sadmap4Courners - LekmapFourCorners

SadmapContinents - LekmapContinents
