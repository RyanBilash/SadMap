An extension of maps introduced in LekMod, and much of the main generation is taken from those files.

If you are going to use this, you also need LekMap (currently v5.2) and LekMod (currently v33.11, but this version isn't all that important for this I think).

You can just drag these files directly into your civ5/Assets/Maps/ directory or you can make a subdirectory civ5/Assets/Maps/Sadmap
